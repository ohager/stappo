# nanoflux-fusion

[__PROJECT SITE__](http://ohager.github.io/nanoflux/)

> Note: Fusion is still in beta, being tested on some real world examples. You may use it already. If you encounter issues feel free to report them! 

A Redux-like extension for Nanoflux.

*nanoflux-fusion* is built on top of [nanoflux](https://github.com/ohager/nanoflux), a quite efficient Flux implementation,  
and adopts the concept of reducer functions for application state management, making Flux even more comfortable.

## Install

Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

```npm install nanoflux-fusion --save```


## Concept

[Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) pushed the Flux evolution with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and proved that application 
state management is possible with a very minimalistic approach. The idea of using reducer functions to alter the state
is very elegant. *nanoflux-fusion* adopts the idea of reducer functions (called *Fusionators*, because naming is fun) to make Flux even more comfortable.
That way, it's not necessary to define any Store. The user just focus on *how* he wants to alter the state using
functions the simply return the new state.

### Example

```javascript

	var NanoFlux = require('nanoflux-fusion');
	
	// NanoFlux provides a dedicated store
	var fusionStore = NanoFlux.getFusionStore();
	
	// subscription is the same as in NanoFlux, note that the function passes a state (which is immutable)
	var subscription = fusionStore.subscribe(this, function(state){
		// ... do something with the state
		// state is also available via fusionStore.getState()
		console.log("Items:", state.items);
	});
	
	// the 'fusionator' is responsible for the state manipulation
	// it is called with two arguments, the previous state
	// and an arguments array containing the arguments passed on actor call.
	NanoFlux.createFusionator({
		
		addItem : function(previousState, args){
			// the previous state is frozen/immutable, so we need to copy the items to update the list
			var currentItems = previousState.items.slice(); 
			currentItems.push(args[0]);
			// we don't need to return the entire state. 
			// A partial state will be merged
			// As builtin feature, the new state is being frozen (deeply)
			return { items : currentItems };
		},
		removeItem : function(previousState, args){
			if (previousState.items.length == 0) return {};

			// note: filter creates a copy already 
			var items = previousState.items.filter(function (item) {
				return item.name !== args[0];
			});
			return {items: items}
		}
	}, 
	// define an initial state!
	{
	 items: []	
	});
	
	// gets the fusion actors, i.e. have the same name as defined above
	var addItem = NanoFlux.getFusionActor("addItem");
	var removeItem = NanoFlux.getFusionActor("removeItem");
	
	// use the actors as simple action functions
	addItem({ name: "item1", value : 1 });
	addItem({ name: "item2", value : 2 });
	
	removeItem("item1");

```

## Immutability
The state passed on notification and/or `getState()` is immutable. Internally, [Object.freeze](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) 
is used to (deeply) freeze the state making it immutable. For large nested states this will have an performance impact (tests will be made to quantify). 
Due to the use of `Object.freeze` the overall performance is not directly comparable with, e.g. nanoflux (which does not guarantee immutability), but should be still fast enough 
for most scenarios.

## Asynchronous Actions

*nanoflux-fusion* supports asynchronous actions out-of-the-box. If a Fusionator returns a promise instead of a state object,
the promise will be executed. The state shall be passed as argument of the resolver. Chaining is also possible. 
*nanoflux-fusion* aims to support all [A+ compliant](https://promisesaplus.com/) implementations. 
It is currently tested with the 

 - [native Promise-API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/)
 - [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/)
 - [RSVP](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/)
 - [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/)
 
 ### Example
 
```javascript

function asyncA(arg1){
	return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
		setTimeout(function(){
			// returns state to be merged
			resolve({a: arg1});
		}, 500)
	})
}
 
function asyncB(arg1){
	return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
		setTimeout(function(){
			resolve( { b: 5 + arg1.a });
		}, 500)
	})
}

var asyncFusionator = NanoFlux.createFusionator({
	
	simplePromise: function(prevState, args){
			return asyncA(args[0]); 
	},	
	chainedPromises: function(prevState, args){
		return asyncA(args[0]).then(function(data){
			console.log(data); // data = {a: 5} 
			return asyncB(data);  
		});
	}
}, 
// initial state
{
	a: 0,
	b: 0
});

var simplePromise = NanoFlux.getFusionActor("simplePromise");
var chainedPromises = NanoFlux.getFusionActor("chainedPromises");

// call the actions
simplePromise(5); // state will be { a: 5 }
chainedPromises(5); // state will be { a: 5, b: 10 }

```

## Middleware Interface

Since version 0.5 a middleware interface is provided. Simply pass a function object with signature ``function(newState, oldState)``
to the ``FusionStore.use``. The middleware function __must__ return a new state, typically the received ``newState`` argument, or a modified version of it (see below). 

```javascript

function LoggerMiddleware(){
	var logData = [];

	this.log = function(newState, oldState){
		logData.push({
		    timestamp: Date.now(),
			state: _.cloneDeep(oldState)
		});

		return newState; // must return a state 
	};

	this.countLogEntries = function(){ return logData.length };
	this.getLogEntry = function(t){
		return logData[t];
	};
}

var fusionStore = NanoFlux.getFusionStore();
var logger = new LoggerMiddleware();
fusionStore.use( logger.log );
// use more if needed ... 
```

#### No async support yet

The current middleware implementation is purely synchronous. Of course, you could execute async operations, e.g. server requests, but the middleware won't wait for the request being finished.  

### New State argument is mutable

The middleware function receives two versions of a state, the new state and the prior/old state *before* the new state is being merged into the application state.
While the old state is immutable, the new state can be modified. That way, the middleware can be used as transformation pipeline. 

```javascript
function addTimestamp(newState, oldState){

		var modifiedState = {};
		modifiedState.modified = Date.now();

		Object.assign(newState, modifiedState);
		return newState;
}

fusionStore.use( addTimestamp );

```

## Compatibility

It should be compatible with all major modern browsers. *nanoflux-fusion* uses internally `Object.assign()` and `Object.freeze()`. While `Object.freeze` is supported since IE9, `Object.assign` was only introduced in EDGE.
Therefore, you need a [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign#Polyfill) for unsupported browsers, i.e. IE9+.
